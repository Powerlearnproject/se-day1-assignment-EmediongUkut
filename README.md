Helps in risk assessment and budgeting.

Requirement Analysis
Gathers and documents user and business requirements.
Ensures clarity on what the software should achieve.

Design
Creates system architecture, UI/UX design, and database models.
Defines software components and interactions.

Implementation (Coding/Development)
Developers write code based on the design specifications.
Uses programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the software.

Testing
Identifies and fixes bugs through unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Ensures the software meets quality standards.

Deployment
Releases the software to users, either in phases or all at once.
May involve cloud hosting or on-premise setup.

Maintenance & Support
Fixes issues, updates features, and optimizes performance after deployment.
Ensures the software remains functional and secure over time

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile are two distinct software development methodologies. Waterfall follows a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase (planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. It is best suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, such as government systems or banking software, where changes are costly and difficult to implement. In contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that allows for continuous development, testing, and feedback throughout the project. Agile is ideal for projects where requirements may change frequently, such as mobile apps or e-commerce platforms, as it enables rapid adjustments based on user needs. While Waterfall ensures predictability and thorough documentation, Agile focuses on speed, collaboration, and adaptability.
When to Use Waterfall
Waterfall is best for projects with fixed requirements and strict regulations where changes are costly. For example, in banking software development, security and compliance regulations require thorough planning, documentation, and testing before deployment. Similarly, government projects like tax processing systems or defense software benefit from Waterfall’s structured approach to ensure reliability and compliance.

When to Use Agile
Agile is ideal for projects where requirements may change frequently and user feedback is crucial. For instance, in mobile app development, features may need adjustments based on user behavior and market trends. Agile allows continuous iteration and updates. Another example is e-commerce platforms, where businesses need to adapt to customer preferences, introduce new features, and fix bugs quickly. Agile ensures rapid development, testing, and deployment to meet evolving demands.
